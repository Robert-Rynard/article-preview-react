## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Modules
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Through this challenge I was able to learn and practice how to implement animations with react and using the useState hook. Most of the animations I have made before this were using CSS only so it was a good experience implementing it with JavaScript as well.

### Continued development

Going forward I would like to implement more animations to the sites I make. I would also like to tackle projects that challenge me to use more of my React and JavaScript skills.
